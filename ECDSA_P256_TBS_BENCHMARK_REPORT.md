# ECDSA P-256 + SHA-256 Benchmark Results - All TBS Sizes

Generated: 2025-07-14

## Summary

Benchmarking was performed on ECDSA P-256 + SHA-256 circuits with different TBS (To Be Signed) certificate sizes. Due to the nature of the commitment scheme, only TBS 700 could be benchmarked with the available test data. Other TBS sizes would require generating certificates of the exact size.

### Test Configuration
- **Signature Algorithm**: ECDSA with P-256 curve (secp256r1)
- **Hash Algorithm**: SHA-256
- **Test Data**: US passport for John Doe

## Results

### TBS 700 - Actual Benchmark Results

Based on multiple benchmark runs with different iteration counts:

| Metric | 5 Iterations | 10 Iterations |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Witness Generation** | | |
| Average | 1,153.2 ms | 1,172.4 ms |
| Min | 1,144.3 ms | 1,168.8 ms |
| Max | 1,158.9 ms | 1,178.5 ms |
| Std Dev | 5.5 ms | 2.9 ms |
| **Proof Generation** | | |
| Average | 2,441.6 ms | 2,472.8 ms |
| Min | 2,431.0 ms | 2,465.7 ms |
| Max | 2,454.9 ms | 2,484.0 ms |
| Std Dev | 9.0 ms | 4.9 ms |
| **Total Time** | | |
| Average | 3,594.8 ms | 3,645.2 ms |
| Min | 3,578.8 ms | 3,634.5 ms |
| Max | 3,608.9 ms | 3,662.5 ms |
| Std Dev | 11.3 ms | 7.3 ms |

### Performance Characteristics

1. **Consistency**: Very low standard deviation (< 1% of average) indicates highly consistent performance
2. **Time Distribution**:
   - Witness generation: ~32% of total time
   - Proof generation: ~68% of total time
3. **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead (~20-145 KB per iteration)

### Expected Performance for Other TBS Sizes

While we couldn't directly benchmark other TBS sizes due to certificate constraints, the circuit complexity scales with TBS size. Based on circuit analysis:

| TBS Size | Circuit Constraints | Expected Time* | Relative to TBS 700 |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 700 | ~310K | 3.6s (actual) | 1.00x |
| 1000 | ~385K | ~4.5s | 1.24x |
| 1200 | ~440K | ~5.1s | 1.42x |
| 1500 | ~525K | ~6.1s | 1.69x |
| 1600 | ~555K | ~6.5s | 1.79x |

*Estimated based on constraint count scaling

### Circuit Details

The circuits follow the naming pattern: `sig_check_id_data_tbs_{size}_ecdsa_nist_p256_sha256`

Each circuit:
- Verifies ECDSA signature with P-256 curve
- Uses SHA-256 for hashing
- Handles certificates up to the specified TBS size
- Includes commitment checks for privacy

## Limitations and Recommendations

### Current Limitations
1. **Certificate Size Matching**: Circuits require exact TBS size matching - padding is not possible due to commitment checks
2. **Test Data**: Only 700-byte certificates were available for testing

### Recommendations for Production Use
1. **Certificate Size Analysis**: Analyze your passport certificates to determine the appropriate TBS size
2. **Circuit Selection**: Choose the smallest TBS size that accommodates your certificates
3. **Performance Budget**: Plan for 3.6-6.5 seconds per proof depending on TBS size
4. **Parallel Processing**: Consider parallel proof generation for batch processing

### Future Improvements
1. Generate test certificates for each TBS size to enable comprehensive benchmarking
2. Implement dynamic TBS size handling if feasible
3. Optimize proof generation for better performance

## How to Run Benchmarks

```bash
# Basic benchmark for TBS 700
./scripts/benchmark-ecdsa.sh -t 700

# With custom iterations
./scripts/benchmark-ecdsa.sh -t 700 -i 50 -f json -o results.json

# For other TBS sizes (requires appropriate test data)
./scripts/benchmark-ecdsa.sh -t 1200
```

## Technical Notes

- The constraint count increases approximately linearly with TBS size
- Each additional 100 bytes of TBS adds ~25K constraints
- Memory usage remains relatively constant regardless of TBS size
- The bb.js backend handles the proof generation efficiently
